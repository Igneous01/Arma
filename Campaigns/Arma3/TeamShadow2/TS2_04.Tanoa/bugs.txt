sfteam 62, waypoint 1 statements did not execute or complete task 
- still happens, probably caused by the squad starting off inside the shed, glitching out their pathing

more conversation and talk back between 62 and shadow, and sead
- added

adjust sleep counters on eta bombing run/etc
- corrected

performance drops - too many ai? look at caching

one of the upsmon markers did not disappear - problem? (southwest of SFTeam Ingress)

upsmon errors in UPSMON_patrolbuilding.sqf

no LOS for AmbientAA Fire (retest this again)

disable debug for ambientAA after this is fixed

make everyone go danger when things blow up?

add sound effect when task is completed
