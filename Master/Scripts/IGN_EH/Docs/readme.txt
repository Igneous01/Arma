	Events

	"An event is a message sent by an object to signal the occurrence of an action.
	The action could be caused by user interaction, such as a mouse click, or it
	could be triggered by some other program logic. The object that raises the
	event is called the event sender. The object that captures the event and
	responds to it is called the event receiver." - MSDN -Events and Delegates for .NET


	This is an 'API' specifically designed for scripters to create and manage their own custom events.
	These set of calls will allow you to specify an event for any situation, as well as allow you to:
	- Register handlers
	- Manipulate handles in the event
	- Delete handlers
	- Raise Event and specify what arguments to pass to handlers
	- Delete Events
	- Create Events for Server, Client, Local with appropriate broadcasts
